// GOALS
// keep notes of errors encountered. does frequency decrease?
// compare and contrast the various approaches. which one was more fun? which one goes into production? why?
// how did you come up with 5 different solutions?

// SPEC
// write a binary chop method that takes an integer search target and a sorted array of integers. it should return
// the integer index of the target array, or -1 if the target is not in the array
// Assume less than 100k elements, performance isn't an issue

    return a + b;

    return -1;
  };
